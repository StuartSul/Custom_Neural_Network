# Homemade Neural Network

This is a simple neural network made without using any external libraries. One might find this useful in educational circumstances.

To run network training and see results, simply execute following command on terminal:

```
python3 main.py
```

For more custom usage, you must adapt and modify code manually.

---
### main.py
Defines necessary hyper parameters and input data, and runs an instance of Trainer.

### network.py
Defines class Network, Layer, and Node, which overall describe neural network structure and functionalities.

### trainer.py
Defines class Trainer, which trains a given network for set amount of time.

### model.py
Saves and loads an instance of network model.
